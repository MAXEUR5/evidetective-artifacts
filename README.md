This repository contains the artifact corresponding to the paper:

> **EVIDETECTIVE: Evidence-Driven Binary Vulnerability Discovery**  
> (anonymous submission – do not add author names or affiliations here)

The artifact implements the evidence-driven workflow described in the paper: for each chain-centric lead, the system maintains an explicit proof state over four proof obligations (O1–O4) and incrementally gathers program-derived evidence to verify or refute vulnerability claims.
